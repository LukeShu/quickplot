Document the changes of reading ASCII files
  comment lines can start with:
     zero or more white space
     '!'-')' '/' '<'-'@' 'C' 'c'

     any non-decimal character sequence can be a separator.
     So -inf +99999 nan inf and decimal point before or after
     an digit cannot be a separator.  A separator any be any
     number of chars. Any combination of Space tab , (if it is
     not a decimal point) * H can be a separator.  You can make
     some pretty messy data files like

     Is read the same as:

     0 nan
     1 10
     2 nan
     3 inf
     4 66.0

     ... assuming you did not tell quickplot to read labels
     for any of that.
     
     nan or NAN is a number that is-not-a-number.
     It can be thought of as 0/0.
     In order to make the channels (columns) that a read in
     all consistent a nan is inserted in place of the blank
     next to the 2 in the second channel.  This keeps the
     values aligned.
     In calculus it is a very popular number, or more
     presciently indeterminate form.
     It's used by quickplot to represent a absent (or missing)
     value in a data channel or field if you will.
     -NAN or -nan is read as nan in quickplot because -nan
     is used in quickplot to mark ends of data.
    
     The above example if we plot the second column VS the first
     column the first point (0,nan) will be skipped in the plot.
     INF or inf stay for a value too large to be read like
     infinity or 1x10^(1000000000000000000000000000000).
     Quickplot with just make a not that there is a large value
     when plotting.  -INF or -inf can be used in a similar
     fashion for large negative numbers.

     Quickplot can parse any plan text file without error.
     But remember garbage in gives garbage out.



Add option to strip nan and/or inf from channels.
