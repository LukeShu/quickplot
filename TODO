Short term developer notes:


bump development version to 0.7.5



See if it is easy to add GNOME sounds to the widget actions.

put ebuild in gentoo

release rpm dist

distribute helloworld_cpp and gtkmm_helloworld

add quick start html doc.



add GNU Free Documentation License for docs



add more (?) to status bar.

remove the use of Field::getName() , and use just getLabel().


Log scales:
add taking logs and/or Log scales with --log command line option??

add taking the Log of the data to the GUI.


Fix the Graph signals so that all mainWindows graphConfigs do not get
the signals too.



need to rewrite the GraphNotebook and MainWindow classes.  They are
too mixed together now.  GraphNotebook should be managing graphs not
MainWindow.


Try preDrawing all the Graphs??? Maybe there's no point to that.



add a Graphs pull down menu that works like the tabs.

add a pointer modes button pad. like in the drawing programs.  get it
from a drawing program along with any thing else we can if possible
(this is a Biggie).

add move to other frame option menu to the tab pop up menu.


VSplit view and H split view?


Add the idea of  bool Field::isDependent(Field *f);
So Plot checks this when it is created.


add: Tabs are blue that have plot that have not been seen. Like galean??


cleanup all error/spew messages so that they can be put in
error/warning/info dialog GUIs when they happen.

make a zoomlevel history tree.


in tab popup add option menu "open in new frame".


put names on the Tabs.

draw a sub-grid under the main grid (dark green default color).

vary the grid number labels font.

zoom history with GUI

log scale??

Clean up the Spew a little, make it prettier.



look at all other 2D plotters and make a html doc comparing them to
quickplot.  requirement  free and run on GNU/Linux.


add help balloons

load a linear field from a menu



See if Plot::drawAutoGrid() will leak memory.


start the scope display stuff

drag files into Graph and than plot it.  Gnome??

can pick different Zoom levels for Plots on the same graph

convert the html docs to docbook docs


command line options

  --usage prints all option flags
  --help  prints all option flags with short explaination 



fix skip line option to work with --skip-lines 2,4,6-10  etc.

fix --label option to work with  --labels LINE   LINE is the line to read the
labels from.


on exit remove the tmp html files??

add an intermediate about top level window before the browser launch as in
epiphany or galeon.

function plot start and stop field markers


convert opSpew to printf's in code.

no default plots option  --no-default-plots



add a prefrences dialog widget


add a popup menu to the tab for   remove, move, rename


add command line option to startup with Graph Config widget.



add some kind of filters for fields.  Example takes log10() of data to
make a new field or replaces the field.


resident and non-resident fields?????add file type to Open file
Dialog.  See gedit's Open Dialog

Change autoGrid font.


add a file open history thingy and/or open history thingy built into
the file open dialog.

        * long term file open history 
        * long and short term directory history



######### later ##############

make a better icon and set of icons
        * use convert to make a set of icons from one large png file.

find a models for the state of the Quickplot program so that it
may save all the settings to a file.




######################### Tried to and stumped as to how to do #############

make --geometry option so it does not show the window and then move
it.
