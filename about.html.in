<h3>What good is Quickplot?</h3>

<blockquote> You can very quickly <em>swim</em> through data with
Quickplot.&nbsp;  I wrote it to do my dynamics work and if other people can
use it, that's great. </blockquote>

<h3>What can Quickplot do other 2D plotters can't do?</h3>

<blockquote>

The difference between this 2D plotter and most 2D plotters is that
the primary purpose of Quickplot is to help you quickly interact with
your data.&nbsp; Of secondary importance is to make a pretty static
picture of your data.&nbsp; Features that distinguish Quickplot
include: one click zooming, any number of plots with different scales
displayed at one time, value picking for any number of plots with
different scales displayed at one time, and reading data from standard
input.&nbsp; These features become indispensable when you're looking
at data sets with 10,000 to 1,000,000 and more data points.&nbsp; You
can't look at a 2D plot with 100,000 points unless you can quickly
zoom.&nbsp; If you need to look at hundreds of files each with 100,000
points, the command line options in Quickplot may save your
sanity.

<p>Quickplot can display sound files with many sound formats.
</p>

<p> Quickplot is more like an interactive data <b>browser</b> than an
interactive picture <b>editor</b>.</p>

<p> All future versions of Quickplot will keep the <em>show me the
data quickly</em> theme.&nbsp; So all future additions to this program
must preserve this quick and lean theme.&nbsp; This does not rule out
the additions that make this program a more full-featured 2D plotter
that one can make pretty pictures with.</p>

<h3>Installation prerequisites</h3>

<blockquote>

Quickplot uses the GNU Autotools (./configure) to build and install.
To build Quickplot from the distribution source tarball
(example: quickplot-%VERSION%.bz2) the following packages are required to be
installed:

<ul>

<li><b><a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/">gtkmm</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   has many prerequisites, but comes with most GNU/Linux
distributions.&nbsp; gtkmm is the official C++ interface for the
popular GUI library <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>.

<ul>
<li>Quickplot version 0.7.8 (and below) works with gtkmm-2.2.* and will not work with gtkmm-2.4.*.</li>
<li>Quickplot version 0.8.0 (and above) works with gtkmm-2.4.* and will not work with gtkmm-2.2.*.</li>
</ul>

<li><b><a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a>
(optional)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a C library for reading and writing
files containing sampled sound (such as microsoft WAV and the
Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard library
interface. Quickplot will not read sound files without libsndfile.

</ul>

To build and develop Quickplot from the <a
     href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=82651">CVS source</a>
the following packages, in addition to the above packages, are
required to be installed:

<ul>

<li><b>The GNU Autotools</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a> version 2.58
or greater, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a> version
1.7 or greater, and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a> version 1.4.3
or greater are used to build the Quickplot source.

<li><b><a
href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
<em>convert</em> program (from ImageMagick) is used to make xpm images
from PNG images in the Quickplot source.


</ul>

<h3>The name and history of this program</h3>

<blockquote> We call it <em>Lanceman's Quickplot</em> in order to
distinguish it from another program called Quickplot which predates
this program.&nbsp; It used to be on NeXT computers.&nbsp; It may
have died with NeXT.

<p>This is a complete rewrite, by the original
author, of the Lanceman's Quickplot which first appeared in 1998, and
managed to find its way into the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> distribution soon
after.</p>

<p> Quickplot started out in 1998 as an Athena Widgets X11 GUI
program, in 2003 it was rewritten as a <a
href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/">QT</a> GUI program, and
in 2004 it was changed to a <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> GUI
program using the <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/">gtkmm</a> C++ wrapper
to GTK+.</p>
