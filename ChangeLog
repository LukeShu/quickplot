2004-04-22   21:35 EST   Version 0.7.0   lanceman


  The last release of Quickplot was version 0.6.5.  In this version, 0.7.0,
  we changed the widget API we use from QT to GTK using GTKmm
  (http://www.gtkmm.org/).  Most of the code was rewritten when going from
  version 0.6.5 to 0.7.0. 

  Some command line options are not interpreted the same.  

	
  Fixed:
	
	reading WAV sound files works for more WAV files types

	the plot manager has been replaced with a better GUI

	
  Added features include:

	Graph Tabs -- kind of like page tabs in a web browser

	multiple main window frames. Like Emacs has "New Frame".  Each
	main window frame uses the same plot data, but the plots are not
	the same, kind of like Emacs buffers are shared between frames.
	
	reads many sound file types using the package libsndfile
	(http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
	
	can plot any field against any field -- version 0.6.5 could not
	plot the same field against itself or fields against fields with
	a different number of values

	zoom levels do not change when plots are added or removed until
	it's zoomed back all the way out, or is forced to by the plots
	added

	by default the scales are set to fit all plots in a graph so long
	as the span of x,y values in all the plots are within an order of
	magnitude of each other.  We retained the "same scales" and
	"different scales" options in addition to this new default called
	"auto scale".

	added the use of the GNU autotools (./configure) to build and install

	added the default GTK command line options

	

  Lost features:

	the QT command line options -- we no longer use QT

	No longer saves xpm image files, since PNG files are much better
	for most purposes, and you can always convert png files to xpm
	files using `convert' from http://www.imagemagick.org/

	The action of the mouse buttons has changed.
