<h2>Terminology</h2>


<p>
We need to distinguish between the two terms plot and graph.&nbsp;
In Quickplot we say we put many plots on a graph.&nbsp;
This process we call plotting.&nbsp;
A graph displays one or more plots.&nbsp;
Quickplot displays each graph in a page tab, like pages in
a web browser.&nbsp;
The distinction between plot and graph is required in order
to understand Quickplot and Quickplot commands.
</p>

<p>
Quickplot can load data from: GUIs (graphical user interfaces), files listed
on the command line, and from standard input (pipes).&nbsp; Data
is loaded into channels.&nbsp; A channel represents a series of numbers,
like for example the values for one variable, or a column of numbers in
a spreadsheet.&nbsp; Other names for channel may be
dimension, coordinate, degree-of-freedom, field, or component.&nbsp;
We call them all channels in Quickplot.&nbsp;
Any two channels may be plotted against each other
whether they are from the same file or not.&nbsp; 
A plot is a graphically representation of two channels, call them the X and Y
channels.&nbsp;
Any number of plots may be made on a graph.&nbsp;
The graph is like the paper we put the plots on.
</p>


<h2>Zooming</h2>


<ul>

<li>
<p>
<b>Grab Zooming</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Put the pointer (mouse) in the graph
window.&nbsp; Press the left mouse button and hold
it while dragging the graph by moving the pointer.&nbsp; Release the left
mouse button and the graph will stop moving with the pointer.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<b>Zooming In</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the pointer (mouse) on a corner of a
plot region you want to zoom to.&nbsp; Press the right mouse button
and hold and drag the zoom box.&nbsp; Release the
right mouse button then it is at another corner of the zoom
region.&nbsp; Now Quickplot will zoom into that zoom region.&nbsp; You
can zoom in as many times as you like.
</p>

<p>
While holding the left mouse button
you can press the shift key or the control key while
pulling the zoom box to "shift" or "resize about the center"
respectively.
</p>

<p>
You can zoom to a view of smaller plots by just pressing and
releasing the right mouse button, without moving the pointer.&nbsp;
Do it again and the plots get even smaller.&nbsp;
You can do this any number of times.
</p>

</li>


<li>

<p>
<b>Zooming Out</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; Put the pointer (mouse) in the graph
window.&nbsp; Press the right mouse button and hold and drag the zoom
box.&nbsp; Release the right mouse button then it (the zoom box) is
past one edge of the graph window.&nbsp; Now Quickplot will zoom out to
the previous zoom level.&nbsp; Pressing the z key will do the same thing.
</p>

<p> Or to zoom out to a full view (top zoom level) of the plot: put
the pointer (mouse) in the plot window.&nbsp; Press the right mouse
button and hold and drag the zoom box.&nbsp; Release the right mouse
button then the zoom box is past two edges (a corner) of the plot
window.&nbsp; Now Quickplot will zoom out to the top zoom level (no
zoom).&nbsp; Pressing the Z (shift-z) will do the same thing.
</p>
</li>



</ul>



<h2>Graph Value Picking</h2>


<p>
<em>(need to write the code for this in 0.9.*)</em>
The middle mouse button is used for picking and
displaying X and Y values from the graph.&nbsp; Just try it and see.
</p>

<p> There are three modes of number display value picking, which may
be selected on the Plot List pop-up window:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Pick Pointer Values</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; shows values where the mouse
pointer is in the scale of the respective plot</li>

<li><b>Interpolate Plot Values</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; shows values where the
X position of the mouse pointer is with the Y value displayed being a
linearly interpolated value</li>

<li><b>Pick Plot Point Values</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; shows X and Y plot point
positions that are closest to mouse pointer X position.</li>

</ul>



<h2>Loadable File Formats</h2>

<p>
Quickplot can read ASCII text and sound files
</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><b>ASCII text</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickplot can load ASCII text (plan
text) files.&nbsp; The number of channels (numbers) on each line must be
the same.&nbsp; Any number of non-number characters other than a new
line character may used to separate numbers on a given line.

<p>
Example:
</p>

<table summary="example data">
<tr><td class=num>-1 </td>  <td class=num> -1.3   </td>   <td class=num> -1</td></tr>
<tr><td class=num> 0 </td>  <td class=num>  1.1e-2</td>   <td class=num>  0</td></tr>
<tr><td class=num> 2 </td>  <td class=num>  NAN</td>   <td class=num>  1</td></tr>
<tr><td class=num> 30</td>  <td class=num>  1.3e+2</td>   <td class=num>  3</td></tr>
</table>



<p>
In Austria it may look like:
</p>

<table summary="example data">
<tr><td class=num>-1 </td>  <td class=num> -1,3   </td>   <td class=num> -1</td></tr>
<tr><td class=num> 0 </td>  <td class=num>  1,1e-2</td>   <td class=num>  0</td></tr>
<tr><td class=num> 2 </td>  <td class=num>  NAN</td>   <td class=num>  1</td></tr>
<tr><td class=num> 30</td>  <td class=num>  1,3e+2</td>   <td class=num>  3</td></tr>
</table>



<p>
The above example has three channels and four samples (set of values) for each
channel.&nbsp; A file may have any counting number of channels, that's
1,2,3,4 or more channels.&nbsp; If a file is loaded with a single channel
an additional channel, with the same number of values as the channel in
the file, will be added before the channel from the file.&nbsp;
Quickplot can also read the numbers NAN (not a number), INFINITY
and numbers larger than the largest double as points that are skipped
when plotting.&nbsp; Any non-number series of characters may be used
to separate numbers, not just spaces and tabs.&nbsp; There must be a
newline character between samples.&nbsp; Any missing numbers will
be automatically read as NAN.&nbsp;
The special values NAN and INFINITY may be read.&nbsp;
When plotting if X and/or Y is NAN or INFINITY the point is just not
plotted making a brake in the connecting line, when lines are drawn.
</p>

<p>
Quickplot can read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>
files.
</p>

</li>



<li>
<p>
<b>libsndfile sound file</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using the package libsndfile Quickplot can
read many sound file formats.&nbsp; An incomplete list of readable
sound file formats includes: Ogg/Vorbis,
Microsoft WAV, SGI/Apple AIFF/AIFC, and
Sun/DEC/NeXT AU/SND.&nbsp; See the <a
href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile home-page</a>
for a full list of supported sound file formats.</p>

<p>
When loading a sound file the first channel (sequence) loaded will be
the time sequence, then each sound channel will follow in separate
channels.&nbsp;

Quickplot may be a little slow with sound files larger than thirty
seconds long.&nbsp; Thirty seconds of sound sampled at 44KHZ with one
channel would load 1.32 million data points.
</p>
</li>

</ul>




<h2>Command Line Options</h2>




<a name=usage_synopses></a>
<h3>Usage: quickplot [OPTIONS]</h3>



<p>
Graphs will be generated for each file loaded, unless options are
given that tell Quickplot to do otherwise.&nbsp; The default number of
plots in a graph will be up to @NUMBER_OF_PLOTS@ plots or just the
number channels in the file minus one if that is less, unless options
override that.&nbsp; The default initial plots will be of all channels
except the first channel in the order that the channel was loaded from a
file plotted against the first channel in the file.&nbsp; A time channel
will be the first channel generated for all sound files loaded.
</p>


<p>
The order of argument options matters.&nbsp;
Options take effect in the order that
they are given with later options overriding
earlier ones.&nbsp;
The options that cause actions like plot "something" must
come after the option that says to read the file that has
"something" in it.&nbsp;
In general the order of argument options gives
the order in which things happen as Quickplot starts up.
</p>


<p>
When using short options, like <em>-n20</em>,
that require an argument may not be grouped with other short
options in one argument.&nbsp; For example the argument
<em>-on20</em>, is not valid, but -oN is a valid argument
with two options <em>o</em> (<em>--no-points</em>) and
<em>N</em> (<em>--no-pipe</em>), and <em>-n20</em>
is a valid option (<em>--number-of-plots=20</em>) that
sets the default number of plots to 20.
</p>


<p>
All of the command line options set things that can
be changed with the Quickplot graphical user interface (GUI).&nbsp;
For example if you start with a graph with no lines and just points
showing, you can click a GUI to add the lines after the program
starts.&nbsp;
