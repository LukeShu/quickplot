What is Quickplot?

Quickplot is an interactive 2D plotter.  You can very
quickly swim through data with Quickplot.  



Quickplot installs HTML (and man pages and etc) files that
document Quickplot better than this file, but if they are
not built and installed yet here's some pointers.



Quickplot is a standard GNU Autotools built package
run:

  ./configure
  make
  make install



or run:

  ./configure --help

for a long list of configuration options.



See http://quickplot.sourceforge.net/about.html for
Installation prerequisites and other details.



There is another optional Quickplot package for development and testing
the Quickplot source code.  Test programs in this package do things
like: display the default Quickplot point and line colors in one window,
or stupid things like read and print "NAN" as a double; just so developers
know.  You can get this "quickplot_tests" package by:


   svn co https://quickplot.svn.sf.net/svnroot/quickplot/quickplot_tests quickplot_tests


This will make the directory quickplot_tests in the current directory.
