Quickplot -- A fast interactive 2-D plotter.


The Quickplot homepage:

        http://quickplot.sourceforge.net/


Requirements:


  pkg-config

    You need the program pkg-config in your PATH.  See:
    http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/pkgconfig .


  gtkmm and other dependence

    gtkmm is a C++ wrapper of the GNOME widget API, The GIMP Toolkit
    (GTK).  There's other packages that gtkmm depends on.  See:
    http://www.gtkmm.org/ for information. Quickplot version 0.7.8
    (and below) works with gtkmm-2.2.* and will not work with
    gtkmm-2.4.*.  Quickplot version 0.8.0 (and above) works with
    gtkmm-2.4.* and will not work with gtkmm-2.2.*.


  libsndfile (optional)

    See: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/


To build and install:


        ./configure --prefix=PREFIX_DIR
        make
        make install



PREFIX_DIR could be for example /usr/local which would cause the
installed binary exicutable file to be installed at
/usr/local/bin/quickplot and the put some html files and images in the
directory /usr/local/share/doc/quickplot/html/

There's lots of options to the configure script that can be seen by
running: `./configure --help'.




For developing Quickplot for the source repository:


   Required packages:

   GNU Autotools (for developing)

     To add source and make a new confgiure script you need the GNU
     Autotools.  See: At the time of writing this the GNU Autotools
     versions were found by using the --version option with said
     program:

    running: automake --version && autoconf --version && libtool --version

      GNU automake 1.7.9
      GNU Autoconf 2.59
      GNU libtool  1.4.3


   Quickplot uses the ImageMagick convert program from http://www.imagemagick.org/
   to make xpm images files from png files.


   Check-out the current source from the SourceForge Subversion (SVN) repository run:
     svn co https://quickplot.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/quickplot/trunk quickplot


   to build and install from the source repository:

        ./bootstrap
        ./configure --prefix=PREFIX_DIR
        make
        make install



   to clean for SVN run the script:

        ./svnclean



Building on Windows: This may happen some day.

   Options:

     1. Skip building it and get the windows binary release which
   you can get to from the Quickplot homepage,
   http://quickplot.sourceforge.net/.


     For all other windows build options you need to install gtkmm
   first.  How you install gtkmm will likely determine how you install
   Quickplot  See http://www.gtkmm.org/ for information on gtkmm.  If
   you want Quickplot to read sound files get libsndfile at
   http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/.

     2. Bloodshed Dev-C++ -- quickplot.dev is a Dev-C++ project file.
   You can get the Bloodshed IDE (integrated development environment)
   package Dev-C++ from the homepage at http://www.bloodshed.net/, or
   try: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/.

     3. MinGW -- You can also use the MinGW without the Dev-C++ IDE.
   For instructions on installing MinGW see http://www.mingw.org/.
   From the MinGW xterm-like thingy you can run: untar the quickplot
   tarball and cd to dirstory that is created (quickplot-VERSION/) and
       run:
              ./configure
              make
              make install

     4. CYGWIN -- http://www.cygwin.com/.  I haven't gotten a good
   build of gtkmm on cygwin yet, but quickplot builds just fine until
   it trys to link to the gtk and gtkmm libraries, which I haven't built
   with cygwin.

     5. MS Visual C++ -- We are not into blowing $2,000 on software we
   don't use.  If your into it send a patch with a VC++ project file.
