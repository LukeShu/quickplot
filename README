Requirements:

    You need the program pkg-config in your PATH.  See:
    http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/pkgconfig .


  gtkmm and dependence

    gtkmm is a C++ wrapper of the GNOME widget API, The GIMP Toolkit
    (GTK).  There's other packages that gtkmm depends on.  See:
    http://www.gtkmm.org/ for information.


  libsndfile (optional)

    See: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/


  GNU Autotools (for developing)

    To add source and make a new confgiure script you need the GNU
    Autotools.  See:   At the time of writing this the GNU Autotools versions
    were found by using the --version option with said program:

      aclocal (GNU automake) 1.7.9
      libtoolize (GNU libtool) 1.5
      autoheader (GNU Autoconf) 2.58
      automake (GNU automake) 1.7.9
      autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.58





To build and install:


        ./configure --prefix=PREFIX_DIR
        make
        make install



PREFIX_DIR could be for example /usr/local which would cause the
installed binary exicutable file to be installed at
/usr/local/bin/quickplot and the put some html files and images in
the directory /usr/local/share/doc/quickplot/html/

There's lots of options to the configure script that can be seen by
running:  `./configure --help'.





For developing:


   to build:

        ./bootstrap
        ./configure --prefix=PREFIX_DIR
        make
        make install



   to clean for CVS:

        ./cvsclean
