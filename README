What is Quickplot?

Quickplot is an interactive 2D plotter.  You can very
quickly swim through data with Quickplot.  



Quickplot installs HTML (and man pages and etc) files that
document Quickplot better than this file, but if they are
not built and installed yet here's some pointers.



Quickplot is a standard GNU Autotools built package
run:

  ./configure
  make
  make install



or run:

  ./configure --help

for a long list of configuration options.





Installation prerequisites

Quickplot uses the GNU Autotools (./configure) to build and install.
To build Quickplot from the distribution source tarball
(example: quickplot-0.9.0.tar.bz2) the following packages are
required to be installed:

    * GTK+          has many prerequisites, but it all comes with most
                    GNU/Linux distributions.
                    http://www.gtk.org/

    * libsndfile    is a C library for reading and writing files
                    containing sampled sound, such as Ogg/Vorbis,
                    microsoft WAV, and the Apple/SGI AIFF format,
                    through one standard library interface.

Development prerequisites

To build and develop Quickplot from the SVN source the following
packages, in addition to the above packages, are required to be
installed:

    * GNU Autotools   Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool are used
                      to build the Quickplot source.
                      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
                      http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
                      http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

    * ImageMagick     The convert program, from ImageMagick, is
                      used to make xpm images from PNG images in
                      the Quickplot source.
                      http://www.imagemagick.org/

    * Lynx            Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web
                      (WWW) client, or web browser, that can
                      display inside of a tty terminal.  We use
                      Lynx to generate ASCII text files from our
                      html files.

There is another optional Quickplot package for development and testing
the Quickplot source code.  Test programs in this package do things
like: display the default Quickplot point and line colors in one window,
or stupid things like read and print "NAN" as a double; just so developers
know.  You can get this "quickplot_tests" package by:


   svn co https://quickplot.svn.sf.net/svnroot/quickplot/quickplot_tests quickplot_tests


This will make the directory quickplot_tests in the current directory.
